# Stratagem-Mage
Simple tool to enable Voice Commands for Helldivers 2 Stratagems. WIP.

Add or delete Stratagems in the Config window. The name is what will be picked up by the voice recognition software (System.Speech.Recognition library courtesy of Windows. Works great for this application!). The inputs need to be in wasd.

Example: 
  Name: Eagle 500
  Inputs: wdsss

Check which boxes you wish to enable then x-out the Config. The main window will pop up and then you're rolling! The Stratagem Mage won't call in any stratagems by default unless you're holding the CTRL key, but there's a checkbox to disable that if you really want to freestyle.

This was a low-effort project that took me two afternoons. Hope it's somewhat entertaining for you!
