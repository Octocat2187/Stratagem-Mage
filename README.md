# Stratagem-Mage
Simple tool to enable Voice Commands for Helldivers 2 Stratagems. WIP.

If it crashes on opening, Give it a couple more tries. Multiple threads are trying to create a file or something. I don't care enough at the moment to fix it, but it should only happen like once.

Don't have all stratagems in yet. if I remember I'll shove some more in later.

A bit slower than punching in the simpler strats by hand, but faster than I can drop a hellbomb by hand

Just run this thing whenever you're playing and it'll work automatically.

Probably not considered cheating?
